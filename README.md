# 🛠️ DevOps AI Agent with LangGraph

This project is an end-to-end **AI-powered DevOps assistant** designed to generate, validate, and deploy infrastructure using tools like **Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes**. It was developed with **LangGraph** to handle tool orchestration and includes a modular backend (FastAPI-style) and a **React frontend** for conversational interaction.

> 🌐 Built as a technical showcase during my interview with Xnode.

## 💡 Features

* 🧠 **LangGraph-powered DevOps Agent** (no shortcut `create_react_agent`)
* 🗣️ Conversational frontend to generate infrastructure setup requests
* 🐳 Docker build, run, list, and cleanup tools
* ☁️ Terraform code generation, validation, apply, and destroy support (Azure VM provisioning)
* ☸️ Kubernetes deployment/service creation and validation
* 📝 File-saving utilities to persist generated code
* 📦 Memory manager for conversation and task state
* ✅ Unit tests for agent actions and tools

## 🧪 Sample Agent Capabilities

### 🔧 Query: “Build and deploy a Docker app to Kubernetes”

**Result:**

* Generates a Hello World app (`app.py`) in `agentcode/`
* Builds Docker image
* Creates Kubernetes deployment & service YAML
* Deploys to the user’s cluster

### 🌩️ Query: “Provision an Azure VM using Terraform”

**Result:**

* Generates `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`
* Initializes, validates, and applies the Terraform plan

### 🗂️ Query: “Save the generated app to `agentcode/hello.py`”

**Result:**

* Writes content to specified path and creates folders as needed
